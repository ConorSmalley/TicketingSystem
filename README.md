###Lets use Git properly - It's good but it's not quite Carling

#####Step 1 - Pull from above

Before you starting working. Ensure that you are working on your own branch in your local repository, the one in Netbeans, then do a **pull** request from the **master branch** from the online repository (Github). This will **automatically merge** into your local branch.

#####Step 2 - Do some graft

Making sure that you're on your **own** branch, DO SOME WORK. If not revert the changes if any and repeat step one properly.

#####Step 3 - Committing changes

Once you have done some hard graft and you are ready to upload your work to Github, you need to ***add and commit** the changes to your **local repository** first (within Netbeans).

1. Still making sure that you are on your **own branch**, first you want to use the **add** command to add the changed file ready to be committed.

2. Now you can used the **commit** command to commit the changes to your local repository on your own branch. Please attach a nice message.

3. Once all the changes are committed, you can now **push** the changes to Github. Making sure you are still on your **own branch**, you can use the **push** (also within Netbeans) command to upload your changes to your **own online branch** in the online repository on Github.

#####Step 4 - Merge my master

Now your work some be uploaded to your **online branch**. If not please consider professional help. Now you need to merge **your branch** to the **master branch**. This is done by selecting your branch on Github and comparing the changes with the master branch and with a bit of God's help, hope it can merge automatically. Create a **pull request** and **confirm** the pull request. **Last but not least** Remember to **merge** the pull request and also **accept the merge** as well.

#####All is well but not complete

Now **repeat all** the steps again. **No shortcuts no cheating**.
